An enhanced version of FlameHUD, for.. me. Yeah, this is for my personal use. I will not be doing any support if you encounter any issues.

# Installation
Click on the code button and download it via .zip file, then bring the extracted folder to ../tf/custom.

[Get the vanilla version here.](https://huds.tf/site/s-Flame-Hud)

# To-dos
- [ ] Adding "more" customizations than what FlameHud has.
- [ ] Major UI fixes.
- [ ] GameMode fixes. (Only tested in Casual and MVM.)
- [ ] Checking if the HUD is acting okay on other resolutions. (Optimized for 1366x768 only. Oops.)
